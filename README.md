# 140-Character-Politics-Continued
140-Character-Politics-Continued is my project to enrichment and analyze political tweets as cataloged in Alex Littel's 140 Character Politics repository 'congress tweets' - https://github.com/alexlitel/congresstweets

The complier.py imports tweet data from Mr.Litel's site, which is updated quite regularly, and adds useful information about the politician behind each cataloged tweet, such as which district they represent, how long they have been in office, when they are next up for reelection, etc...

I hope the added breadth of the set can help lead to some cool analyses as the list of tweets expandes in length!
